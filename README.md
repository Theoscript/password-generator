# Password Generator

Online security is more crucial than ever. With digital threats evolving, the need for secure, hard-to-crack passwords is undeniable. Although I'm not overly concerned with practices such as data collection, I believe that my accounts and everyone else's should remain private and secure. I created this password generator to help people establish control over their online accounts by generating strong, randomized passwords.

Many people use passwords that can be cracked in seconds. I aim to make secure password creation easy, giving users an effortless way to protect themselves from data breaches and account takeovers.

## Current Issues and Planned Updates

Although I'm happy with where the project is at right now there are some improvements that can be made to enhance the overall user experience.

1. **Font Fixes:** Right now the font is ideal but it isn't the one I wanted to display. I added custom local font hosting but didn't pay attention to my file paths and it never rendered. When I attempt to remove the custom font all font sizes appear a lot smaller than their declarations in the CSS so this is on my list to fix at some point.
2. **Responsive Layout Improvements:** Currently the layout is narrow to accomodate for small screens but this isn't optimal for the larger screens that might access the application. I plan to create a more adaptable design, optimized for both mobiles and large screens to ensure the app looks and functions well across devices.

## Future Potential: A Full Password Management Service

I envision transforming this pretty basic app into a comprehensive password management service. This could include user accounts, secure storage of passwords, and features like password audits, all aimed at keeping personal data safe. While this is a **long-term** goal, it's an exciting possibility for the app's future.
